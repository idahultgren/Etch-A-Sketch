# Etch-A-Sketch
First thing i built after some time off from trying to learn JavaScript. 
Use the sketchpad to create a pixel art masterpiece! 
- Select a color for your pen or use the random button to get a randomized color.
- Swipe the mouse over the sketchpad to paint.
- Use the Eraser to remove unwanted art or use the Clear button to clear the sketchpad.
- Change pixel size of the sketchpad using the Change size button, add a number between 1-100 in the pop-up.

# Technologies and tools
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Visual Studio Code
- Git and GitHub

# Things I want to add in the future:
- Ability to use shading
- Change the size button to a slider
